		<p><b>A new, easy-to-use movie recommendation service.</b><br>
			If you are ever unsure about what movie to watch, we have you covered with our Movie Database recommendation software.
			The intuitive interface allows users to get a movie recommendation from a database filled with user curated films. 
			Movie recommendation has never been more simple thanks to our website's reliance on user interaction, and it's so simple that you don't even need to create an account.
			Just click <a href=movie/>here</a> to get started.
		</p>
		<p> 
			The user is able to search up a film to obtain general information about the film, along with a trailer and poster. 
			Once a film is searched with the interface, it can then be pulled by the server as a recommendation of a movie to watch for another visitor.
			Alternatively, you can search up the film by its given IMDB ID, which will allow you to pull the information directly from the Dynamo Database where it is being stored.
			<br><br>Feel free to explore and contact us via the 'Contact' page if you have any 
			questions or comments!<br><br><br><br><br>
